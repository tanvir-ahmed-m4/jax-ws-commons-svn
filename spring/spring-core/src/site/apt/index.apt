What is this?

  When your application uses
{{{http://www.springframework.org/}Spring}} for wiring your code,
you'll find it more convenient to use the same Spring for configuring
JAX-WS. For example, that would allow your service implementations to
receive resource injection via Spring, AOP stuff, logging, etc, etc.
 This RI extension provides this functionality.

  Another purpose of this extension is to provide a general purpose
mechanism that JAX-WS extension authors can use, to let users use
their extensions. For example, when you write a custom transport,
custom codec, or custom pipeline assembler, you can use Spring to
allow users to configure your extensions.

  This is easier to do, compared to other "closed" deployment
mechanism like JSR-109.



Quick Start

  Let's consider the most typical case, where you develop a web
application and you want to deploy JAX-WS services. First your
<<<web.xml>>> needs to have a JAX-WS servlet registered (if servlet
could be deployed from Spring without <<<web.xml>>>, we could have
gotten rid of this altogether!)

---------------------------
<web-app>
  <!-- this is for Spring -->
  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
  </listener>

  <!-- these are for JAX-WS -->
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>jaxws-servlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSSpringServlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>jaxws-servlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/add</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
  ... if you deploy more services,
  you might need more <servlet-mapping>s ...
</web-app>
---------------------------

  Then you'd be writing something like this in your <<</WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml>>>:

---------------------------
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:ws="http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/spring/core"
  xmlns:wss="http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/spring/servlet"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd
    http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/spring/core
    http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/spring/core.xsd
    http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/spring/servlet
    http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/spring/servlet.xsd">

  <wss:binding url="/add" service="#addService" />
  <wss:binding url="/sub">
    <wss:service><!-- nested bean is of course fine -->
      <ws:service bean="#myService" />
    </wss:service>
  </wss:binding>

  <!-- this bean implements web service methods -->
  <bean id="myService" class="foo.MyService" />

  <!-- simplest definition only needs the class name -->
  <ws:service id="addService" impl="foo.MyAddService" handlers="#myHandler"/>

  <bean id="myHandler" class="foo.MyHandler" />

</beans>
---------------------------

  The two <<<wss:binding>>> definitions define what services are
exposed to which part of the URL space. In the above code,
it deploys two services on two URLs, and one with a handler.

  If you know Spring, you should know the "rest", like how to
configure your own service beans.
