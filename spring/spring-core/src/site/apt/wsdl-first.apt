Working with existing WSDL

  When you'd like to deploy an endpoint with existing WSDL, you need to tell the JAX-WS runtime the association between the WSDL and your service. This is done by adding a few more attributes/elements to the <<<ws:service>>> element like this:

---------------------------
<ws:service bean="#myService" serviceName="tns:fooService" portName="tns:foo" xmlns:tns="http://my/service/nsURI">
  <ws:primaryWsdl>
    <value>/WEB-INF/wsdl/</value>
  </ws:primaryWsdl>
</ws:service>
---------------------------

  The portName attribute works like <<<@WebService(portName=...)>>> (except that it's a real QName), and the primaryWsdl element works like <<@WebService(wsdlLocation=...)>>> (except that it can take forms other than String.) If the primary WSDL is omitted, the runtime will search for WSDL in <<</WEB-INF/wsdl/>>> and find one that matches the specified port and service name.
