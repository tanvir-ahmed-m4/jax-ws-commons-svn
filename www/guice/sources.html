<h1>Sources</h1>

This project uses <a class="externalLink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
 to manage its source code. 
 Instructions on Subversion use can be found at 
 <a class="externalLink" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>.

<h3>Web Access</h3>
<p>The following is a link to the online source repository.</p>
    <a class="externalLink" href="https://jax-ws-commons.dev.java.net/source/browse/jax-ws-commons/trunk/guice">
        <pre>https://jax-ws-commons.dev.java.net/source/browse/jax-ws-commons/trunk/guice</pre>
    </a>

<h3>Anonymous access</h3>
<p>The source can be checked out anonymously from SVN with this command:</p>
<pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.dev.java.net/svn/jax-ws-common/trunk/guice guice</pre>

<h3>Developer access</h3>
<p>Everyone can access the Subversion repository via HTTP, but Committers must checkout the 
Subversion repository via HTTPS.</p>
<pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.dev.java.net/svn/jax-ws-commons/trunk/guice guice</pre>
<p>To commit changes to the repository, execute the following command to commit your changes 
(svn will prompt you for your password)</p>
<pre>$ svn commit --username your-username -m &quot;A message&quot;</pre>

<h3>Access from behind a firewall</h3>
<p>For those users who are stuck behind a corporate firewall which is blocking http access to 
the Subversion repository, you can try to access it via the developer connection:</p>
<pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.dev.java.net/svn/jax-ws-commons/trunk/guice guice</pre>

<h3>Access through a proxy</h3>
<p>The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it to do so. First, 
edit your &quot;servers&quot; configuration file to indicate which proxy to use. The files 
location depends on your operating system. On Linux or Unix it is located in the directory 
&quot;~/.subversion&quot;. On Windows it is in &quot;%APPDATA%\Subversion&quot;. 
(Try &quot;echo %APPDATA%&quot;, note this is a hidden directory.)</p>
<p>There are comments in the file explaining what to do. If you don't have that file, get the latest 
Subversion client and run any command; this will cause the configuration directory and template files to be created.</p>
<p>Example : Edit the 'servers' file and add something like :</p>
<pre>[global]
http-proxy-host = your.proxy.name
http-proxy-port = 3128
</pre>
